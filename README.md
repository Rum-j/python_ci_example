about github
- after PR of other branch
- you have to pull at local shell from main branch 

on VSC
- test: automatically test files (on initial setting, unitttest - *_test.py is selected)
- you can test files when you click test above the list of files

on code climate
- code in below means unittest skip
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":  # pragma: no cover " 
```
